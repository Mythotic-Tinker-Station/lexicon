// this is a very special cvar with all kinds of versatility to control the replacer system
//
// this cvar can have multiple flags seperated by a space(or multiple spaces)
// that change the way the replacer replaces things
//
// for example: "normal    replace:ZombieMan:ArchVile replace:Archvile:ZombieMan"
//
// the exmaple above would set all actors to their mapset version,
// however all zombiemen will be replaced with archviles, and all archviles will be replaced with zombiemen.
// this cvar only effects objects that are place in maps, it does not effect spawns
//
// note: that there is no error checking for this system, if you typo something, the replacer will not do what you want it to without telling you why.
//
// list of flags:
//		normal								Normal replacer operation, this replaces actors with mapset specific ones(this flag overrules all the other flags, except replace and ignore)
//		ignore:<class>						Tells the replacer to ignore a specific class, this spawns the vanilla version of an actor no matter what(unless the replace flag is used)
//		replace:<class1>:<class2>			Tell the replacer to forcefully replace <class1> with <class2>
//		monsters:[<class>]					Replace all monsters with their mapset versions(if they exist), 		<class> is optional, if exists, all monsters are replaced with <class>
//		keys:[<class>]						Replace all keys with their mapset versions(if they exist), 			<class> is optional, if exists, all keys are replaced with <class>
//		decoratives:[<class>]				Replace all decoratives with their mapset versions(if they exist), 		<class> is optional, if exists, all decoratives are replaced with <class>
//		ammo:[<class>]						Replace all ammo with their mapset versions(if they exist),				<class> is optional, if exists, all ammo is replaced with <class>
//		weapons:[<class>]					Replace all weapons with their mapset version(if they exist), 			<class> is optional, if exists, all weapons are replaced with <class>
//		items:[<class>]						Replace all items with thier mapset version(if they exist), 			<class> is optional, if exists, all items are replaced with <class>
//		blank								If the cvar is blank, everything will be the vanilla actors, regardless of mapset
//		randomize_monsters					replaces all monsters with randomly selected ones
//		randomize_monsters:stealth			replaces all monsters with randomly selected ones, including stealth monsters
//		randomize_monsters:boss				replaces all monsters with randomly selected ones, including boss monsters
//		randomize_monsters:boss:stealth		replaces all monsters with randomly selected ones, including stealth and boss monsters
//		randomize_weapons					replaces all weapons with randomly selected ones
//		randomize_ammo						replaces all ammo with randomly selected ones
//		randomize_items						replaces all items with randomly selected ones
