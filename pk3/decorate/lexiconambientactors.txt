/*
	Base class for sound emitters which replace the ambient monster sounds on various mapsets

	The majority of ambient sounds in vanilla mapsets are handled with inaccessible monsters which 
	play their active sound through A_Chase. A facet of this is active sounds won't play over each 
	other. Below is a setup to emulate this behavior.

	States
	{
		Spawn:
			TNT1 A 3
			TNT1 A 0 A_Jump(3, "MakeSound")
			Loop
		MakeSound:
			TNT1 A 30 A_PlaySound("AMBIENT/SOUND", CHAN_VOICE, 1.0, false, ATTN_IDLE)
			Goto Spawn
	}

	Since every call to A_Chase has a 3/256 chance of playing the active sound, A_Jump has the chance
	set to "3" he tic durations.

	The tic duration next to A_PlaySound is caclulcated with the following formula:

	Sound duration (sec) * 35 tics/sec - # tics in first frame â‰ˆ tic duration
