Build Time              : The oldest textures here are from 1998. So 20+
                          years?
Editor(s) used          : Photoshop, SLADE3, Dual Heights Caustics Generator
May Not Run With        : Vanilla can't handle some of the texture sizes, and
                          won't support the ANIMATED and SWITCHES
                          definitions. Also, there's too many lumps.
Tested With             : Eternity, GZDoom, PrBoomPlus

You are free to redistribute, wholly or partially, these assets with your

You are free to modify these textures as you see fit, but please consider
using patches to form new textures where possible, rather than adding new
lumps.

Kindly also mention me in the credits as "Ola Björling (ukiro)".

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you make some alteration you think
is useful for others, as I may then opt to include it future versions.
