Compilation
-----------

###Windows
Follow the instructions at the [megasource][megasource] repository page.

###*nix

	$ platform/unix/automagic
	$ ./configure
	$ make

###Mac OS X

Then use the Xcode project found at `platform/xcode/love.xcodeproj` to build the `love-macosx` target.

###iOS
Download the required libraries from [here][dependencies-ios] and place the `include` and `libraries` folders
into the `platform/xcode/ios` folder.

Then use the Xcode project found at `platform/xcode/love.xcodeproj` to build the `love-ios` target.

See `readme-iOS.rtf` for more information.

###Android

Repository information
----------------------

We use the 'default' branch for development, and therefore it should not be considered stable.
Also used is the 'minor' branch, which is used for features in the next minor version and it is
not our development target (which would be the next revision - version numbers are formatted major.minor.revision.)

We tag all our releases (since we started using mercurial), and have binary downloads available for them.

Experimental changes are developed in the separate [love-experiments][love-experiments] repository.

Contributing
------------

The best places to contribute are through the Bitbucket issue tracker and the official IRC channel.
For code contributions, pull requests and patches are welcome. Be sure to read the [source code style guide][codestyle].

Builds
------

Releases are found in the 'downloads' section on bitbucket, are linked on [the site][site],
